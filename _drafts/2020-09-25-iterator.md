If you have been a `C++` programmer for a while, you should know, or at least hear about `iterator`. If you have `C` background, it's very likely you will interpret `iterator` as `C` pointer and most of time, you don't care about it (because you will not use it usually in production code). When you start using STL container, you can be more familiar with `iterator`, but still most of time you don't want to write your for loop with iterator (specially, when we have range-base for loop now). Nevertheless, when you start using the STL algorithm, you cannot ignore iterator anymore: the entire library is built on top of iterator. Then you start digging the iterator and algorithm section on cppreference. And still, you cannot understand everything, but you start having some idea about the iterator concept, and you probably will start write code in STL styles with iterator and template meta-programing (that happens to me).

This article is not about the whole iterator library. This is about `vector` (and anything look like a vector) and how vector iterator works. In addition, I want to write about `rotate` - the simple algorithm, but turn out to be powerful make life easier.

# The iterator concept

Iterator is a object that we can use to traverse a container. The iterator object will usually hold the memory address of the actual element in the container.
