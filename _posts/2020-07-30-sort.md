Recently, when I asked one of my friends what is he doing, he said he is learning merge sort. That is several months ago from the last time I write a sorting algorithm. I realize that I have never written a perfect sorting code, therefore I decided to make one here. My goal is STL-style sorting templates: they should consume the `first` and `last` iterators, and sort the elements in between. Let start with quicksort.

Quicksort is the easiest in all `O(NlogN)` sorting algorithm. The idea of quicksort is quite similar to insertion sort: At every step, it picks an element called `pivot` and finds the right position to place that element. However, quicksort does even more than that: it also makes all elements on the left of `pivot` smaller than all elements on the right, so we can sort the left partition and right partition independently. If every step, we can reduce the size of the array by half, there are total `logN` steps and `N` comparisons for each step, therefore its complexity in the idea case is `O(NlogN)`. The naive solution should be like:

```cpp
template<class forwardIter>
void quickSort(forwardIter begin, forwardIter end) {
  if (begin >= end) return;
  auto pivot = end;
  pivot--;
  auto it = begin;
  for (auto it0 = begin; it0 != end; ++it0) {
    if (*it0 < *pivot) std::iter_swap(it++, it0);
  }
  std::iter_swap(it, pivot);
  quickSort(begin, it, comp);
  quickSort(it+1, end,comp);
}
```

The default quick sort in STL uses `<` as comparator. There is another version which allow us to pass the comparator. This is how it is implemented:

```cpp
template<class forwardIter, class Comp>
void quickSort(forwardIter begin, forwardIter end, Comp& comp) {
  if (begin >= end) return;
  auto pivot = end;
  pivot--;
  auto it = begin;
  for (auto it0 = begin; it0 != end; ++it0) {
    if (comp(*it0, *pivot)) std::iter_swap(it++, it0);
  }
  std::iter_swap(it, pivot);
  quickSort(begin, it, comp);
  quickSort(it+1, end,comp);
}

template<class forwardIter>
void quickSort(forwardIter begin, forwardIter end) {
  using value_type = typename std::iterator_traits<forwardIter>::value_type;
  typename std::less<value_type> comp;
  quickSort(begin, end, comp);
}
```

Pretty much that is. The above quick sort is quite fast. Compare to the STL implementation, it's about `25%` slower on [Leetcode test set](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/). What makes the difference? I take a look at the [SGI STL implementation](https://github.com/karottc/sgi-stl) (which was later merged with GCC). 

```cpp
template <class _RandomAccessIter, class _Tp, class _Size>
void __introsort_loop(_RandomAccessIter __first,
                      _RandomAccessIter __last, _Tp*,
                      _Size __depth_limit)
{
  while (__last - __first > __stl_threshold) {
    if (__depth_limit == 0) {
      partial_sort(__first, __last, __last);
      return;
    }
    --__depth_limit;
    _RandomAccessIter __cut =
      __unguarded_partition(__first, __last,
                            _Tp(__median(*__first,
                                         *(__first + (__last - __first)/2),
                                         *(__last - 1))));
    __introsort_loop(__cut, __last, (_Tp*) 0, __depth_limit);
    __last = __cut;
  }
}

template <class _RandomAccessIter, class _Compare>
inline void sort(_RandomAccessIter __first, _RandomAccessIter __last,
                 _Compare __comp) {
  __STL_REQUIRES(_RandomAccessIter, _Mutable_RandomAccessIterator);
  __STL_BINARY_FUNCTION_CHECK(_Compare, bool,
       typename iterator_traits<_RandomAccessIter>::value_type,
       typename iterator_traits<_RandomAccessIter>::value_type);
  if (__first != __last) {
    __introsort_loop(__first, __last,
                     __VALUE_TYPE(__first),
                     __lg(__last - __first) * 2,
                     __comp);
    __final_insertion_sort(__first, __last, __comp);
  }
}
```

It turns out that GCC use [intro sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort), an algorithm similar to quicksort but will switch to heapsort when the recursion depth excesses a certain limit. By doing so, the worst-case complexity of intro sort is `O(NlogN)`, compared to `O(N^2)` of quicksort. Therefore, STL `sort` is perfectly safe for production code.

The next one is mergesort. The idea of mergesort is simple: divide the array into smaller arrays, sort the smaller arrays and merge the results. But the implementation is more complicated than quick sort. The `vector` version of my mergesort work perfectly, but the generic version runs into infinitive loop for no reason. After a while, I finally made it, but the code look quite complicated:

```cpp
template <class forwardIter, class Comp>
void merge(forwardIter begin, forwardIter middle, forwardIter end, Comp& comp) {
  if (begin >= middle || middle >= end) return;
  int n = end - begin;
  using value_type = typename std::iterator_traits<forwardIter>::value_type;
  typename std::vector<value_type> buf(n);
  auto it0 = begin, it1 = middle;
  auto it2 = buf.begin();
  while (it0 != middle && it1 != end) {
    if (comp(*it0, *it1)) *it2++ = *it0++;
    else *it2++ = *it1++;
  }
  while (it0 != middle) {
    *it2++ = *it0++;
  }
  while (it1 != end) {
    *it2++ = *it1++;
  }
  std::copy(buf.begin(), buf.end(), begin);
}

template <class forwardIter, class Comp>
void mergeSortPow2(forwardIter begin, forwardIter end, Comp& comp) {
  if (begin >= end) return;
  int len = 1;
  int n = end - begin;
  while (len < n) {
    for (auto it = begin; it != end; it += 2*len) {
      auto lo = it, mid = lo + len, hi = mid + len;
      merge(lo, mid, hi, comp);
    }
    len *= 2;
  }
}

template <class forwardIter, class Comp>
void mergeSort(forwardIter begin, forwardIter end, Comp& comp) {
  if (begin >= end) return;
  size_t len = 1;
  auto n = end - begin;
  while (2*len <= n) {
    len *= 2;
  }
  mergeSortPow2(begin, begin+len, comp);
  mergeSort(begin+len, end, comp);
  merge(begin, begin+len, end, comp);
}

template <class forwardIter>
void mergeSort(forwardIter begin, forwardIter end) {
  using value_type = typename std::iterator_traits<forwardIter>::value_type;
  typename std::less<value_type> comp;
  mergeSort(begin, end, comp);
}
```

My merge sort algorithm is bottom-up: I start with each element as a sorted range and start to merge all adjacent ranges until there is only one range left. However, this only works with the array with length is the power of `2`. In order to merge an arbitrary size array, I will first find the largest sub-array with length is power of 2, run `mergeSortPow2` on that array, then run `mergeSort` on the remaining, then finally merge the result. I found this D&C strategy to work very well in other problems such as [array shuffle](). The above merge sort is about `1.8x` slower than STL `stable_sort`. The implement of STL `stable_sort` is quite long, but there are two main different points:

1. STL `stable_sort` is top-down, and when the array length is smaller than 15, it uses insertion sort

2. STL `stable_sort` have the option to merge the array in-place.

When the array is small, insertion sort is better than merge sort or quick sort; and in-place merge can save memory allocation time.

Finally, heapsort, the fanciest `O(NlogN)` sorting algorithm that I know. But to write heap sort, we need to know the heap data structure first. Therefore, I will leave it for the next article when I write about heap.
