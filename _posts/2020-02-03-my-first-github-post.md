Well, that is my first blog post on github. I actually have another blog at wordpress where I share stories of my life as well as my thought on the meaning of life. However, this blog is somewhat different. It's a science-centric blog where I share my research work, knowledge I've learn and some thougts in academic life. Hope I can enjoy it.
Cheer,
DC Le
By the way, just for testing the mathematical formula  
$$\mu=\frac{1}{nhw}\sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^{h}\sum_{j=1}^{w}p_{ij}^{(k)}$$
