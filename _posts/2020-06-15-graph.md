In programming, graph is a concept that consists of `vertices` and `edges` between the vertexes. Usually, a graph with `N` vertices with labels from `0` to `N-1` can be represented with two data structure:

- Adjacency list: vertices are stored as objects and every vertex stores a list of its adjacent vertices. 
- Incidence matrix: a matrix `G` with `G[x][y]` indicates the connection between the vertices `x` and `y`.

A graph can be undirected or directed, and unweighted and weighted. A graph `G` is called un-directed if the edges in `G` is undirected. If the edges have direction, we call G a directed graph. Similarly, a graph is un-weighted if all edges have the same weight and weighted if edges have different weights.

The basic operator on graphs is from one vertex, we want to explore other vertices in the graph. This can be done with two basic algorithms: bread-first search and deep first search. In addition, the article will cover some other advanced topics: using DFS in decision tree problem, Dijkstra & bellman-ford algorithm, minimum spanning tree problem, and directed acyclic graph with topological sorting problem.

> *Note:* The BFS and DFS section assume the most basic scenario: un-directed, and un-weighted graph

# Bread-first search - BFS

In BFS, we start from one vertex and visit all neighbors of that vertex first and repeat the procedure with neighbor vertices until all vertices are visited. This usually implemented with `queue`:

```cpp
/*
Input: 
  - graph as adjacent list G
  - source vertex x
*/
void bfs (vector<vector<int>>& G, int x) {
  const int n = G.size();
  queue<int> node;
  vector<int> visited(n);
  visited[x] = true;
  while (!q.empty()) {
    int k = q.size(); 
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
      auto node = q.front();
      q.pop();
      // do job with node here
      for (auto &v : G[node]) {
        if (!visited[v]) {
          visited[v] = 1;
          q.push(v);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return;
}
```

Note that in BFS, the closest vertices to the source are visited first, therefore, BFS can be used to find the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph. In the unweighted graph, we have [Dijkstra algorithm](#dijkstra-algorithm), but the behind idea is very similar to BFS. The time complexity of `BFS` is `O(|V|+|E|)` and space complexity is `O(|V|)` with `V` is set of vertices and `E` is the set of edges of the graph.

# Depth-first search - DFS 

In DFS, we start from one vertex and visit all vertices in one branch of this vertex first and repeat the procedure with other vertices until the graph is explored. We can implement DFS with recursive method or iterative method with stack:

```cpp
/*
Input: 
  - graph as adjacent list G
  - source vertex x
*/
void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& G, int x) {
  const int n = G.size();
  vector<int> visited(n);
  // recursive or iteratice
  dfs_recursive(G, visited, x);
  // dfs_iterative(G, visited, x);
}
void dfs_recursive(vector<vector<int>>& G, vector<int>& visited, int x) {
  if (visited[x]) return;
  visited[x] = 1;
  // do the job with x here
  for (auto &v : G[x]) {
    dfs(G, visited, v);
  }
}
void dfs_iterative(vector<vector<int>>& G, vector<int> &visited, int x) {
  stack<int> stk;
  stk.push(x);
  visited[x] = 1;
  while (!stk.empty()) {
    auto node = stk.top();
    stk.pop();
    // do the job here
    for (auto &v : G[node]) {
      if (!visited[v]) {
        visited[v] = 1;
        stk.push(v);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In DFS, we tend to move far as much as possible from the source vertex and only go back when we cannot go further, therefore, DFS is good when we need to find a specific vertex in a big graph. Though, both DFS and BFS can be used to discover all vertices of a graph with the same time complexity `O(|V|+|E|)` and space complexity `O(|V|)`

# DFS for path-finding

When we have a decision tree, we usually want to go to leaf nodes of the tree and check what is the result of the decision we\'ve made. We usually use DFS in this case, because we don\'t need to explicitly construct the graph. The most familiar problem to me is the subset problem: assume we have a set of `n` different items and we want to find a subset of `n` items that in oder to maximum some metric. In the worst case, we need to do brute-force to find all subset of the given set. We can do that with DFS:

```cpp
void dfs(vector<int> &items, int id, vector<int> &subset) {
  const int n = items.size();
  if (id >= n) return;
  for (int i = id; i < n; ++i) {
    // do include current id in our subset
    subset.push_back(items[i]);
    // calculate and update the metric with subset
    // explore other possibility when we do include items[i]
    dfs(items, i+1,subset);
    // backtrack, explore other possibility when we do NOT include items[i]
    subset.pop_back();
  }
}
```

The procedure is very similar to backtracking. As each item will have to state: in the subset or not, the complexity of the solution is `O(2^n)`, which is quite terrible. However, when `n` is small or we can early terminate a branch, we can apply this solution.

# Dijkstra algorithm

When working with graph, we usually need to find the shortest path from one source vertex to another vertex (or all vertices) in the graph. When the graph is unweighted, we can use BFS, however, we cannot do the same thing with weighted graphs. If we use DFS, we will come up with a solution with exponential (or even factorial) time complexity. Luckily, we have an efficient algorithm to do this: the Dijkstra algorithm.

> *Note:* Dijkstra algorithm only works if we have no negative edges

The idea of Dijkstra algorithm is similar to BFS: we select the closest vertex to visit first. When using BFS, we push all the neighbors of the current vertex to a queue. Because the graph is un-weighted, the front of the queue is always the closest vertex to the source vertex. In weighted graph, we can do the same things, but now the front of the queue is not necessary the closest vertex, so we cannot pop from the queue in FIFO manner. In stead, we want the vertex at the top of the queue should have the smallest distance to the source vertex. This can be achieved with a `min heap`. Remind that heap is a data structure that help us to find the min or max of a ranges in `O(1)` with penalty on `Olog(N)` `insert` and `delete`. In C++, we already the heap: `priority_queue`. So we can implement Dijkstra similar to BFS with `priority_queue`:

```cpp
/*
Input: 
  - graph as adjacent list G
  - source vertex x
Output:
  - shortest paths from x to all vertices in G
  - predecessor nodes to reconstruct the paths
*/
const int INF = 1e9+7;
pair<vector<int>, vector<int>> dijkstra (vector<vector<pair<int,int>>>& G, int x) {
  const int n = G.size();
  vector<int> distance(n,INF);
  vector<int> pred(n,-1);
  priority_queue<pair<int,int>, vector<pair<int,int>>, greater<pair<int,int>>> pq;
  distance[x] = 0;
  pred[x] = x;
  pq.push({0,x});
  while (!pq.empty()) {
    auto [dist, node] = pq.top();
    pq.pop();
    if (dist != distance[node]) continue;
    for (auto &[id, w] : G[node]) {
      if (dist + w > distance[id]) {
        distance[id] = dist + w;
        pq.push({distance[id], id});
        pred[id] = node;
      }
    }
  }
  return {distance, pred};
}
```

The complexity of the Dijkstra algorithm is `O((|V|+|E|)log|V|)`: similar to BFS, but now `push` to queue and `pop` from queue have `O(log|V|)` complexity. The Dijkstra will not work if there are negative edges. You can imagine that if the Dijkstra algorithm meets a negative edge, it will make the distance to two vertices of this edge become minus infinity by moving back and forth on the negative edges in an infinity loop.

# Bellman-Ford algorithm

As noted above, Dijkstra algorithm only works if we have no negative edge. The more general version of Dijkstra algorithm is Bellman-Ford algorithm that can work with negative edges (but no negative cycle). Both Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford algorithm works by relaxation, in which we approximate the minimum distance by assign them some initial values and replace them with better values until they reach the optimal state. However, in Dijkstra algorithm, we use a priority queue to greedily choose from a set of candidates to relax the distance. Bellman, in another hand, simply relaxes all distance, and repeats it for `|V| - 1` times with `V` is the set of vertices. Bellman claims that by repeating the relaxation `k` times, we will found the shortest path to all vertices within `k` edges. The formal proof of the bellman force algorithm can be found [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs161/cs161.1168/lecture14.pdf).  

In addition, Bellman-Ford algorithm can also detect the negative cycle in the graph. After relaxing `|V| - 1` times, we do an addition `|V|th` iteration. If there is some distance updated in this iteration, we can say that there are negative cycles in the graph. We can imagine that the graph has only `|V|` vertices, but there is the shortest path with `|V|` edges (or `|V|+1` vertices). Therefore, the path with `|V|+1` vertices must have at least one repeated vertex, in other words, there is a cycle in the paths. If this path is the shortest path, if we cut the cycle out of the path we will have a longer path, which indicates the cycle must have negative weights!

```cpp
/*
Input: 
  - graph as adjacent list G and possible negative edges
  - source vertex x
Output:
  - vector of minimum distance from x to other vertices in the graph
  - predecessor nodes to reconstruct the paths
*/
const int INF = 1e9+7;
pair<vector<int>, vector<int>> bellman(vector<vector<pair<int,int>>>& G, int x) {
  const int n = G.size();
  vector<int> distance(n, INF);
  vector<int> pred(n,-1);
  distance[x] = 0;
  pred[x] = x;
  // construct the list of edges
  vector<tuple<int,int,int>> edges;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (auto &[id, w] : G[i]) {
      edges.push_back({i,id,w});
      edges.push_back({id,i,w});
    }
  }
  // repeat the relaxation n-1 times
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    // update the weighs for all edges in list
    for (auto &[from, to, w] : edges) {
      if (distance[from] + w > distance[to]) {
        distance[to] = distance[from] + w;
        pred[to] = from;
      }
    }
  }
  // last iteration to check negative cycles
  for (auto &[from, to, w] : edges) {
    if (distance[from] + w > distance[to]) {
      throw std::logic_error("Graph have negative cycles");
    }
  }
  return {distance, pred};
}
```

The algorithm have complexity `O(|V|*|E|)`, thus it\'s slower than Dijkstra algorithm. Therefore, Bellman algorithm is usually used when the graph is spare.

# Minimum spanning tree (MST)

In a weighted graph, MST is the subset of edges that connect all vertices in the graph, without any cycles, and has minimum weight. In this article, we assume that the MST always exists in the graph. There is two most popular algorithm to find the MST in the graph: Prim algorithm and Kruskal algorithm. However, the Kruskal algorithm requires `Disjoin Set`, which is not a trivial data structure. So, this will be cover in the [Union Find]() article.

Prim is a greedy algorithm. It maintains two sets of vertices: the vertices that are in the spanning tree, and the vertices that are not. Starting with an empty spanning tree, at each step, it considers all edges that connect the two above sets and pick the edge with minimum weight and moves the endpoint of these edges to the set contains MST. When implementing a prime algorithm, we only need to maintain one set that keeps track of vertices in the MST and stop the algorithm when the size of this set is equal to the size of the vertices set.

```cpp
/*
Input: 
  - graph as adjacent list G
Output:
  - array of predecessor to reconstruct the mst
  - the total weight of the mst
  - throw an error if the graph have no spanning tree
*/
int INF = 1e9+7;
pair<vector<int>,int> primMSP(vector<vector<pair<int,int>>>& G) {
  const int n = G.size();
  vector<int> pred(n,-1);
  vector<int> visited(n,0);
  int total = 0;
  // the initial spanning tree is empty, so we can put vertex 0 to it
  distance[0] = 0;
  pred[0] = 0;
  // distance node prev
  priority_queue<tuple<int,int,int>, vector<tuple<int,int,int>>, greater<tuple<int,int,int>> > pq;
  pq.push({0,0,0});
  while(!pq.empty) {
    auto [d, node, prev] = pq.top();
    pq.pop();
    // if already in mst then continue
    if (visited[node]) continue;
    // add this to the mst
    pred[node] = prev;
    visited[node] = 1;
    total += d;
    for (auto &[v,w] : G[node]) {
      // just add all of them to queue
      pq.push({w,v,node});
    }
  }
  // check if all node visited
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!visited[i]) throw logic_error("Graph have no spanning tree");
  }
  pair<vector<int>,int> ret;
  ret.first = move(prev);
  ret.second = total;
  return ret;
} 
```

The above implementation has time complexity of `O((|V|+|E|)log|E|)` and space complexity `O(|E|)`. This is bad when the graph is dense. We can make do it better to reduce the time complexity to `O((|V|+|E|)log|V|)` and space complexity to `O(log|V|)` by storing the vertices instead of the edges.

# Directed acyclic graph and topological sort

A directed graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) if it has no cycle. It\'s easy to check if the graph is DAG. We can do the DFS and maintain the current vertices in our exploring branch. If we visit a vertex again, there is a cycle. The complexity of the algorithm is the complexity of the DFS.

```cpp
/*
Input: 
  - graph as adjacent list G
Output:
  - 0 if graph is DAG, false if not
*/
bool isDAG(vector<vector<int>>& G) {
  const int n = G.size();
  vector<int> visited(n,0);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!dfs(G, visited, id)) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
bool dfs(vector<vector<int>>& G, vector<int>& visited, int id) {
  if (visited[id] == 1) return true;
  if (visited[id] == 2) return false;
  // mark visited id == 2 as it is in our exploring branch
  visited[id] = 2;
  for (auto &v : G) {
    if (!dfs(G, visited, id)) return false;
  }
  // mark visited id == 1 as we done with it;
  visited[id] = 1;
  return true;
}
```

DAG can be very useful when modeling the task scheduling problem when tasks may have dependencies. Usually, we want to know whether there is a valid schedule for all tasks and if there is, return the schedule. This problem is usually known as topological sort: given a directed graph, if this is DAG, sort the vertices so that there are only edges from lower vertices to higher vertices. We can solve this problem by both DFS and BFS. Both have same complexity `O(|V| + |E|)`

## DFS topological sort

By nature, the order of *return* time of the DFS will give us the reverse of topological sort order. Because DFS will follow a branch until it cannot do so, when dfs on a vertex returns then either this node have no edge to other vertices, or dfs on its successors must have been done. Therefore, we can implement topological sort with DFS by simply put the vertex to our answer when the DFS on that vertex return.

```cpp
/*
Input: 
  - graph as adjacent list G
Output:
  - topological order of vertices in the graph
  - throw an error if graph has cycle
*/
vector<int> topoSort(vector<vector<int>>& G) {
  const int n = G.size();
  vector<int> visited(n,0), answer;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (!dfs(G, visited, ans, id)) throw logic_error("Graph contain cycles");
  }
  reverse(ans.begin(), ans.end());
  return ans;
}
vector<int> dfs(vector<vector<int>>& G, vector<int>& visited, vector<int>& ans, int id) {
  if (visited[id] == 1) return true;
  if (visited[id] == 2) return false;
  // mark visited id == 2 as it is in our exploring branch
  visited[id] = 2;
  for (auto &v : G) {
    if (!dfs(G, visited, id)) return false;
  }
  // mark visited id == 1 as we done with it;
  visited[id] = 1;
  ans.push_back(id);
  return ans;
}
```

## BFS topological sort

First, we define the `indegee[id]` of the vertex `id` is the number of edges points to that vertex. It\'s obviously if the topological sort exists, it must start with vertices with zero `indegree`. So we can add all vertices with zero `indegree` to our answer. Then, we remove those vertices and update the `indegree` and repeat the procedure until all vertices are in our answer. The implement is very similar to BFS: we add all vertices with zero `indegree` to a queue, each time we pop one vertex from the queue, remove that vertex from the graph, update the `indegree` array, and add new zero `indegree` vertices to the queue. If the final answer does not contain all vertices, we can conclude the graph has cycles.

```cpp
/*
Input: 
  - graph as adjacent list G
Output:
  - topological order of vertices in the graph
  - throw an error if graph has cycle
*/
std::vector<int> topoSort(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& G) {
  const int n = G.size();
  // in-degree[i]: number of edges that point to this vertex
  std::vector<int> in_degree(n,0);
  for (auto &v : G) {
    for (auto &node : v) {
      in_degree[node]++;
    }
  }
  std::vector<int> ans;
  // we will push all vertex with 0-indegree to this queue
  std::queue<int> q;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (in_degree[i] == 0) {
        q.push(i);
        ans.push_back(i);
    }
  }
  while (q.size()) {
    auto node = q.front();
    q.pop();
    for (auto &v : G[node]) {
      // remove node
      in_degree[v]--;
      // only push to queue if the node is zero-degree
      if (in_degree[v] == 0) {
        ans.push_back(v);
        q.push(v);
      }
    }
  }
  if (ans.size() != n) throw logic_error("Graph have cycles");
  return ans;
}
```
