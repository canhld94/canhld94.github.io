        Hi, I am Duc Canh Le from Vietnam. I'm currently a research scientist at Grid Middleware Center, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. 
        I got my master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in 2020. Before that, I got my B.E degree from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in 2017. I also had one and haft year at Viettel Corporation as an algorithm engineer from mid-2016 to 2018. 
        I love computers and everything about it except Window update. I'm on my way to becoming a server-side software developer to make software faster and more reliable to users.
